    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4.2 oz (120g) dark chocolate 70%+ cocoa. Use baking or cooking chocolate</li>
        <li>⅓ cup (70g) caster sugar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons (70g) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (20g) cornstarch cornflour UK</li>
        <li>1 + ½ cups (360ml) whole milk (full-fat)</li>
        <li>Sunflower oil for greasing (see notes)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <em>Requires 3 hours chilling time.</em>
    <ol>   
        <li>Gently heat the milk in a saucepan, bring to a boil then immediately turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a separate saucepan, once melted add the sugar and whisk the mixture until it thickens and turns a pale yellow colour (almost like a roux).</li>
        <li>Next, turn the heat down low and add the chocolate. Stir it gently until melted. Sift in the cornstarch and stir it in so there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>A little at a time, add the hot milk until fully combined into the chocolate mixture. Turn the heat up to medium and stir it for about 3-5 minutes until thick and glossy.</li>
        <li>The budino is now ready to pour into moulds or ramekins. Important: if using moulds make sure to lightly grease each one with a little sunflower oil first. If using ramekins or glass serving dishes you can pour the budino straight in.</li>
        <li>Let it cool to room temperature then chill in the fridge for at least 3 hours. Remove from the fridge for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        
    </ol>

    <h3>How to remove Budino from moulds</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the budino from the fridge 5 minutes before serving. Give the mould a shake from side to side to help loosen the budino from the edges.</li>
        <li>Turn it out onto a plate and shake the budino once or twice to dislodge it from the mould, serve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Note on chocolate:</strong> Make sure to use baking or cooking chocolate as regular chocolate can have a gritty or chalky texture when melted. 70%+ cocoa gives the best results.</li>
        <li><strong>If using moulds:</strong> If you plan on using a mould, even if it's silicone or non-stick you MUST grease the moulds lightly with a little sunflower oil first or the budino will be hard to remove. You don't need to do this if you are serving it in ramekins or glass serving dishes.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The budino is best eaten within 2 days but will last for up to 4-5 days in the fridge. Do not freeze.</li>
        <li><strong>The moulds we used:</strong> The moulds that we used to shape our budino in the photos were purchased from Ikea. Panna cotta moulds or silicon moulds also work really well - all of them must be greased with sunflower oil first!</li>
    </ul>
