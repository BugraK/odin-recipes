    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs -yolks and whites separated</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>10 oz (280g) bittersweet chocolate</li>
        <li>10 oz (280g) unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>3 cup (280g) super-fine almond flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar (to dust cake)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 10” springform pan with butter and dust with cocoa powder. Set aside until needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F and place an oven rack in the center of the oven.</li>
        <li>Add the egg whites and ½ cup of the granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.</li>
        <li>Whip the ingredients on high speed until stiff peaks are formed (5- 6 minutes). Transfer the whipped egg whites to a large bowl and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Place the chocolate in a metal or heatproof glass bowl that fits on top of a small saucepan. Add one inch of water to the saucepan over high heat.
            <p>When the water begins to boil, reduce the heat to simmer and place the bowl on top of the saucepan to make a double boiler.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>Stir the chocolate with a silicone spatula until fully melted. Set the chocolate aside to cool slightly while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add the butter and remaining ½ cup of sugar to the (clean) bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.</li>
        <li>Whisk the butter and sugar on high speed until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks one at a time to the mixer. Make sure each egg is mixed in before adding another. Repeat until all the eggs have been incorporated into the mixture.</li>
        <li>.Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and add the almond flour to the mixture. Fold the almond flour in by hand until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the melted chocolate to the mixture. Fold the chocolate into the mixture by hand until combined.</li>
        <li>Add the egg white mixture to the batter and gently fold the cold whipped egg whites into the batter. Mix just enough to combine fully.
            <p><em>Do not use an electric mixer or try to whip the egg whites into the batter, or they will deflate.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan and place it on the center rack of the preheated oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove the torta caprese from the oven and place it on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Run a knife alongside the inside edges of the springform pan and remove the ring from the torta. Return to the wire rack and let the cake cool completely.</li>
        <li>Dust the cooled torta with confectioners sugar and serve.</li>
        <li>Serve the torta slightly warm, or at room temperature.</li>
        <li>The torta can be served as is or with vanilla ice cream or homemade whipped cream and berries.</li>
    </ol>
